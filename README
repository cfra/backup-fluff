## Overview

This currently backs up legacy hosts with [rsync](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/rsync-net-zfs-replication-to-the-cloud-is-finally-here-and-its-fast/)

Backup is done to a zfs dataset and each successful run is stored in a snapshot.

```
# zfs create tank/backups
# cp example.conf /tank/backups/
# ./run-backup-job /tank/backups/example.conf
